## üìÇ Projects

Here are some of the projects I have been working on:

# Real-Time Match Result Predictor  

A machine learning model designed to predict the outcomes of English Premier League matches in real-time, leveraging match statistics, player data, and fixture details.

## Features  
- **Outcome Prediction**: Forecasts match results (home win, away win, or draw) with percentage probabilities.  
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically updates weekly with new match data, enhancing prediction accuracy over time.  
- **Realistic Dynamics**: Factors in home team advantage, rank bias, and points bias to provide reliable predictions.  
- **Player and Team Insights**: Includes player stats, top performers, and team rankings for detailed analysis.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Deployed using Flask with an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly UI.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning**: For predictive modeling and statistical analysis.  
- **Flask**: To host the application and provide a seamless user experience.  
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model implementation.  

## How It Works  
1. **Data Integration**: Combines match statistics, player performance data, and fixture results.  
2. **Prediction**: Outputs probabilities for home wins, away wins, and draws based on machine learning models.  
3. **Weekly Updates**: Automatically incorporates new gameweek data into the model for continuous improvement.  
4. **Interactive Visualization**: Displays the Premier League table, player stats, and match predictions in a visually appealing format.

# [Tripster: The Ultimate Vacation Planner](https://github.com/<your-username>/tripster)

A web-based travel planning application designed to streamline the vacation planning process by curating travel options and presenting them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Trip Planning**: Allows users to input trip details like departure city, destination, travel dates, and hotel city to generate tailored results.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: Fetches and displays flights, hotels, cabs, and activities from CSV files in a structured and aesthetic manner.
- **Modern Design**: Responsive and elegant user interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS for a seamless user experience.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Processes data quickly, making it ideal for smaller-scale projects or local deployment.
- **Data Visualization**: Organizes travel options into tables, enabling users to easily compare and finalize plans.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: For backend logic and hosting the application.
- **Python**: For processing data and rendering results dynamically.
- **Pandas**: For efficient handling of CSV files and data transformation.
- **HTML & CSS**: To create an interactive and visually appealing front end.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users provide essential travel details through a simple form.
2. **Data Processing**: Reads travel options (flights, hotels, cabs, and activities) from preloaded CSV files.
3. **Results Display**: Outputs the data in categorized tables for easy interpretation.
4. **Customizable Flow**: Modular design allows for easy integration of additional features like real-time API data.
